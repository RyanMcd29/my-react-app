                I'm looking for a more integrated role in developing applications from the ground up and 
                learning how they work and interact with the user. I have experience using Shopify to manage products, 
                customers and to create a website.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm always looking for new technologies and techniques to help me become a better developer, and I'm eager 
                to explore unfamiliar territory to expand my skills.
